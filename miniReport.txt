Project Status: Almost Complete
All core modules (Voter, Candidate, Voting Manager) are implemented and integrated. 
The system supports voter/candidate registration, geographic polling stations, AVL tree + hash table data structures, persistent storage, and election management.

Remaining Tasks Before Final Submission:
Add input validation & error handling for edge cases
Test all edge cases (collisions, disk full, invalid inputs)
Log voting actions to a secure file.
Bipartite graph visualization for voter-candidate relationships 
Huffman compression for data storage.
Final documentation and code comments
